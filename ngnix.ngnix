we will start learning how we can use ngnix for profuction level thing for proper routing and all 

so basically ngnix is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. It is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

we will explore each one of these features in detail, but first, let's start with the basics of how to set up and configure Nginx.
// Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. It is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.
// Nginx is often used to serve static content, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as to handle dynamic content generated by web applications. It can also be used to proxy requests to other servers, such as application servers or databases, and to load balance traffic across multiple servers.

it can be attached to any web application based on any framework like React, Angular, Vue, or even plain HTML/CSS/JS applications. Nginx can serve static files directly and can also be configured to forward requests to backend servers that handle dynamic content.
// Nginx is often used in production environments to improve performance, security, and scalability of

we can use docker to run nginx in a containerized environment. This allows for easy deployment and management of Nginx instances, as well as the ability to scale up or down as needed.

the main benfit of using ngnix is we dont have to serve all the static files from our application server, which can be resource-intensive. Instead, we can offload this task to Nginx, which is optimized for serving static content efficiently.

// ADVCICE for production pushing or runnning the application in production
-->> we will create two seperate containers one for build phase and then another one for run phase at ngnix level 


so we have to connect or link the two containers together. This can be done using Docker Compose, which allows us to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
